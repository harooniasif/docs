The visibility score is your brand's total share-of-voice in the AI landscape. A higher visibility score means more LLMs are sourcing answers from you, thus making you visible to users.

## Why this matters:

* Shows how visible you are in AI search compared to competitors.  
* Provides a single benchmark to measure improvement over time.  
* Helps leadership quickly grasp brand performance in generative search.
