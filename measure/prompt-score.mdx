title: "Prompt Score"
description: "Understanding your brand's coverage across different prompts"
---

This counts the total mentions of your brand across selected prompts. A single prompt counts once, even if multiple LLMs mention your brand.

## Why this matters:

* Shows the breadth of your AI visibility across different questions.  
* Highlights whether your brand is broadly discoverable or limited to niche prompts.  
* Tracks expansion into new areas of generative search.
