Prompt mentions score captures the top prompts where your brand is mentioned, and the % share-of-voice you hold among those prompts. The higher the percentage, the better.

## Why this matters:

* Reveals which prompts drive the most exposure for your brand.  
* Identifies competitive strengths and gaps at the query level.  
* Prioritizes which prompts to optimize content for.
