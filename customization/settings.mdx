#  Settings and Account Management

Click your avatar in the top-right corner and select **Settings** to access account and organisation controls. This isn't just about managing your account - it's about understanding how your organizational context shapes your brand monitoring strategy and capabilities.

## Why Organizational Context Matters ally

BrandRadar operates at the organizational level, enabling multiple brands and teams to coexist within a shared monitoring framework. Understanding your organizational context is crucial because it:

- **Shapes your strategic capabilities** through plan limitations and features
- **Enables team collaboration** on brand intelligence and insights
- **Provides resource visibility** for strategic planning and allocation
- **Supports multi-brand strategies** for organizations with multiple brands

<Info>
** Access:** Click your profile avatar in the top-right corner of the interface, then select "Settings" from the dropdown menu to access your organizational context and strategic capabilities.
</Info>

##  Profile Management

View and edit your name and other personal details (your email address is typically fixed).

**Why this matters strategically:** Your profile information helps BrandRadar understand your role in the organization and enables team collaboration on brand intelligence. Keeping this information current ensures optimal platform experience and strategic insights.

##  Companies & Plans

Shows all organisations you belong to and indicates plan type, number of prompts used, and current billing cycle. Buttons such as **Edit users** and **Manage subscription** let you add or remove team members and adjust your plan.

**Why this matters strategically:** Understanding your plan capabilities and usage is crucial for strategic planning. It shows you what strategic monitoring capabilities you have available, how efficiently you're using your resources, and whether you need to upgrade to support your strategic goals. Team management enables collaborative brand intelligence and strategic decision-making.

##  Brand Cards

Each brand is displayed as a card under its organisation. Click a card to switch your active brand.

**Why this matters strategically:** Brand cards enable strategic portfolio management, allowing you to compare how different brands in your portfolio perform across AI platforms. This multi-brand view helps you identify cross-brand opportunities, allocate monitoring resources strategically, and understand your overall brand portfolio performance.

##  Billing History

See past invoices and payment status. (In some views this may show "No Data" if no invoices have been generated.)

**Why this matters strategically:** Billing history provides visibility into your strategic investment in brand monitoring and helps you track the ROI of your BrandRadar usage. Understanding your investment helps you make informed decisions about plan upgrades and strategic resource allocation.

##  Support Chat

A floating chat icon opens a conversation with BrandRadar support. Use it for help or feedback.

**Why this matters strategically:** Support chat enables you to get strategic guidance on how to optimize your BrandRadar usage for your specific business needs. It's not just technical support - it's strategic consultation on how to get the most value from your brand monitoring investment.
