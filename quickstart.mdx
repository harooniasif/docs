# Setup Flow

### 1. Organizational Context

Visit [app.brandradar.ai](https://app.brandradar.ai) and start the signup process. You'll be prompted to enter:
- Your full name
- Parent company name  
- Email address

### 2. Initial Brand Creation

Next, you'll create your first brand through a 3-step process that teaches the AI to recognize and understand your brand:

 **Brand information**
- Brand name
- Website
- Brand variations
- geographic locations
- What your brand does
- What you're known for
- Add your main competitors


### 3. Prompt Suggestions

After completing brand creation, you'll see auto-generated topics and prompts based on your brand information. You can:
- **Accept** suggestions that align with your priorities
- **Decline** suggestions that don't match your monitoring goals
- **Modify** suggestions to better reflect your focus

**Why this matters:** These suggestions aren't random - they're generated based on your brand description and competitive landscape. The AI proposes monitoring themes that are likely to surface meaningful insights about your brand's position and performance. Your choices here define what conversations BrandRadar will track and analyze.

### 4. Plan Selection

After reviewing the auto-generated suggestions, you'll select from our plan options:
- **Startup Plan** - $99/month - Foundation for early-stage teams
- **Growth Plan** - $399/month - Enhanced capabilities for fast-growing teams  
- **Scale Plan** - $999/month - Multi-client intelligence for agencies
- **Enterprise Plan** - $3,999/month - Advanced analytics for large organizations

You'll automatically be placed on a **7-day free trial** for the plan of your choice.

### 5. Dashboard Exploration

Once your account is set up, you'll see the overview dashboard showing your brand's performance and trends. Use the date filter (top right) to adjust the analysis period.

The dashboard isn't just a collection of metrics - it's a command center that shows:
- **Brand visibility composition** across different AI models (revealing which platforms drive your presence)
- **Competitive positioning** through discovered brands analysis
- **Conversation drivers** via top prompts and topics
- **Source credibility** through citation analysis

<Note>
**Dashboard Features:** The overview dashboard transforms raw AI data into insights. Each metric answers specific questions about your brand's position and performance.
