# Quick-Start Orientation

Welcome to BrandRadar's documentation platform! This guide provides a structured overview of the BrandRadar interface, walking you through setup, data collection, navigation, and settings. It is intended for content creators and marketing teams who need to document or understand how to use the platform.

<Note>
**Note on versions:** BrandRadar evolves rapidly. The screenshots and descriptions in this guide were captured in September 2025 and may differ slightly from later releases. Always check for the latest documentation updates.

## 1. Access the Application

Visit [app.brandradar.ai](https://app.brandradar.ai) in a modern browser. After logging in with your BrandRadar credentials, you'll see a dark-themed interface with a vertical navigation bar on the left.

## 2. Select Your Brand

At the top left, there's a brand selector showing the currently active brand. Click it to switch between brands if your organisation monitors multiple ones.
