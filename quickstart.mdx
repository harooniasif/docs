# Quickstart

Welcome to BrandRadar! This guide explains the reasoning behind each setup step, helping you understand how your configuration choices shape your brand monitoring approach and the insights you'll receive.

## Why This Setup Process Matters

BrandRadar's setup isn't just about entering information - it's about defining your monitoring framework. Each step teaches the AI how to recognize your brand, understand your market context, and focus on the conversations that matter to your business.

# Setup Flow

## 1. Organizational Context

Visit [app.brandradar.ai](https://app.brandradar.ai) and start the signup process. You'll be prompted to enter:
- Your full name
- Parent company name  
- Email address


## 2. Foundation

After entering your details, you'll be shown a video onboarding that introduces BrandRadar's approach to brand monitoring.

## 3. Initial Brand Creation

Next, you'll create your first brand through a 3-step process that teaches the AI to recognize and understand your brand:

### Step 1: Brand Recognition Framework
- Brand name
- Website
- Brand variations

**Reasoning:** The AI needs to recognize your brand across different contexts and spellings. Brand variations (misspellings, abbreviations, alternative names) are crucial because people don't always refer to your brand consistently. This comprehensive recognition framework ensures you capture all relevant mentions while filtering out noise.

### Step 2: Locality
- Select the geographic locations where your brand operates

**Reasoning:** Geographic context helps the AI understand your market presence and filter out irrelevant mentions from regions where you don't operate. This prevents false signals from international competitors or unrelated brands with similar names.

### Step 3: Positioning
- What your brand does
- What you're known for
- Add your main competitors

**Reasoning:** This information helps the AI understand your brand's position and competitive landscape. It enables the system to:
- Distinguish between your brand mentions and competitor activity
- Generate relevant monitoring suggestions aligned with your business model
- Provide context for why certain conversations matter to your brand

## 4. Monitoring Framework

After completing brand creation, you'll see auto-generated topics and prompts based on your brand information. You can:
- **Accept** suggestions that align with your priorities
- **Decline** suggestions that don't match your monitoring goals
- **Modify** suggestions to better reflect your focus

**Why this matters:** These suggestions aren't random - they're generated based on your brand description and competitive landscape. The AI proposes monitoring themes that are likely to surface meaningful insights about your brand's position and performance. Your choices here define what conversations BrandRadar will track and analyze.

## 5. Capability Selection

After reviewing the auto-generated suggestions, you'll select from our plan options:
- **Startup Plan** - $99/month - Foundation for early-stage teams
- **Growth Plan** - $399/month - Enhanced capabilities for fast-growing teams  
- **Scale Plan** - $999/month - Multi-client intelligence for agencies
- **Enterprise Plan** - $3,999/month - Advanced analytics for large organizations

**Why this matters:** Different plans unlock different capabilities. More prompts allow broader monitoring, but they must be aligned with the topics that matter to your brand. The plan you choose determines the depth and breadth of insights you can generate.

You'll automatically be placed on a **7-day free trial** for the plan of your choice.

## 6. Dashboard Exploration

Once your account is set up, you'll see the overview dashboard showing your brand's performance and trends. Use the date filter (top right) to adjust the analysis period.

**Why this matters:** The dashboard isn't just a collection of metrics - it's a command center that shows:
- **Brand visibility composition** across different AI models (revealing which platforms drive your presence)
- **Competitive positioning** through discovered brands analysis
- **Conversation drivers** via top prompts and topics
- **Source credibility** through citation analysis

<Note>
**Dashboard Features:** The overview dashboard transforms raw AI data into insights. Each metric answers specific questions about your brand's position and performance.
