#  Platform Navigation

BrandRadar organises its modules along a vertical sidebar, but this isn't just a navigation structure - it's a strategic framework for understanding your brand's position and performance. Each section exists to answer specific strategic questions about your brand's visibility, competitive position, and market narrative.

## Why  Navigation Matters

Understanding why each section exists helps you use BrandRadar more effectively. Each module is designed to answer specific strategic questions:

- **Where does my brand appear** across different AI platforms?
- **Why does it appear there** through strategic prompt analysis?
- **What conversations drive visibility** via topic analysis?
- **How are competitors positioning** through discovered brand intelligence?
- **Which sources influence my narrative** via citation analysis?
