# What are Prompts and Topics

Topics and prompts aren't just organizational tools - they're the framework that shapes how BrandRadar monitors your brand. Unlike traditional monitoring tools that scrape everything, BrandRadar uses targeted queries (prompts) to instruct AI models to look for specific themes, then organizes those insights into organized buckets (topics).

## Why They Matter

The prompts and topics you create determine what conversations BrandRadar will track and analyze. This isn't about monitoring everything - it's about monitoring what matters to your brand. Well-designed prompts and topics provide:

- **Focused monitoring** that aligns with your business goals
- **Relevant insights** that answer your specific marketing questions
- **Competitive intelligence** that reveals market opportunities and threats
- **Actionable data** that drives decision-making
