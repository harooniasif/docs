# Creating Topics and Prompts

Topics and prompts are the foundation of BrandRadar's monitoring capabilities. Topics help organize your monitoring efforts, while prompts are the specific questions that gather data from AI platforms.

<Info>
**Getting Started:** Begin with basic topics like your brand name, then expand to include product names, industry terms, and competitor mentions.
