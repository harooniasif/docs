# Prompt and Topic Design

Topics and prompts aren't just organizational tools - they're the framework that shapes how BrandRadar monitors your brand. Unlike traditional monitoring tools that scrape everything, BrandRadar uses targeted queries (prompts) to instruct AI models to look for specific themes, then organizes those insights into organized buckets (topics).

## Why Design Matters

The prompts and topics you create determine what conversations BrandRadar will track and analyze. This isn't about monitoring everything - it's about monitoring what matters to your brand. Well-designed prompts and topics provide:

- **Focused monitoring** that aligns with your business goals
- **Relevant insights** that answer your specific marketing questions
- **Competitive intelligence** that reveals market opportunities and threats
- **Actionable data** that drives decision-making

## 3.1 Topic Creation

In **Data builder**, open the **Topics** tab. Existing topics appear grouped by categories.

**Why topics matter:** Topics organize your monitoring efforts around themes that matter to your brand. They help you understand which conversations drive your brand narrative and which areas need more attention. A well-organized topic structure enables you to:

- **Group related prompts** under relevant themes
- **Track topic performance** to understand what drives brand visibility
- **Identify gaps** where you need more monitoring coverage
- **Align monitoring** with your marketing and business objectives

Click **Add topic** in the upper right corner. A modal window asks for a **Topic name**.

**Naming considerations:**
- Choose names that reflect your priorities
- Use consistent naming conventions for easy organization
- Consider how topics relate to your business model and market position
- Think about how topics will help you answer questions

Enter a descriptive name and click **Create**. The new topic will appear under **Uncategorised** (or the chosen category).

## 3.2 Prompt Design

Prompts are the questions you ask AI models to gather data about your brand. They're not just data collection tools - they're the framework that determines what conversations BrandRadar will monitor and analyze. Well-designed prompts provide:

- **Focused monitoring** that aligns with your business goals
- **Relevant insights** that answer your specific marketing questions
- **Competitive intelligence** that reveals market opportunities and threats
- **Actionable data** that drives decision-making

You can add prompts from the **Prompts page** or within **Data builder**.



### Via the Prompts Page

Click the **Prompts** icon in the navigation bar. You'll see a list of prompts, with columns for Discovered brands, Prompt score, Sentiment, and Last update.

**Why prompt performance matters:**
- **Prompt score** indicates how effectively the prompt surfaces meaningful mentions
- **Sentiment** shows whether discussions support or undermine your brand narrative
- **Discovered brands** reveals which competitors appear in the same conversations
- **Last update** shows when you last received fresh intelligence

Use the search bar or date picker to filter prompts. To add a new one, click **Add more prompts**; this opens the **Data builder → Prompts** section.

### Via Data Builder → Prompts

In the **Data builder** section, choose the **Prompts** tab. Existing prompts appear in a table with columns for:
- **Prompt text**: The actual prompt content (your question)
- **Associated Topic**: Which topic the prompt belongs to (theme)
- **Status**: Current status (e.g., Completed, Running)
- **Last Updated**: When the prompt was last processed
- **Next Update**: When the next update is scheduled

#### Features:

**Filters and Search:**
- Search by prompt text to find specific questions
- Filter by topic to focus on particular themes
- Control date range for analysis of specific campaigns or time periods

**AI-Generated Suggestions:**
- Click "Suggested prompts" to open a modal
- Describe your brand's goals to receive AI-generated prompt suggestions
- Review and add suggestions that match your needs

**Prompt Creation:**
- Click "Add Prompt" to open the creation modal
- Select a topic from the dropdown (aligns with your themes)
- Choose update frequency (daily, every 2 days, weekly, etc.)
- Input your prompt text
- Click "Save" to create the prompt

The system will schedule and run the prompt at the chosen interval, providing ongoing intelligence.
