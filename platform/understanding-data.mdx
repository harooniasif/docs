#  Data Interpretation

BrandRadar's metrics aren't just numbers - they're strategic signals that reveal how your brand appears across AI platforms and what that means for your market position. Understanding these metrics helps you make strategic decisions about your brand narrative, competitive positioning, and monitoring strategy.

## Why  Data Interpretation Matters

In an era where AI models increasingly shape how people discover and perceive brands, understanding your brand's AI visibility is crucial for strategic success. BrandRadar's metrics provide:

- **insights** about your brand's position in AI-driven conversations
- **Competitive intelligence** that reveals market opportunities and threats
- **Performance indicators** that show how effectively your monitoring strategy works
- **Trend analysis** that helps you attribute changes to specific campaigns or events

<Info>
**Data Sources:** BrandRadar collects data from multiple AI platforms including OpenAI, Gemini, and Perplexity to provide comprehensive insights about how your brand appears across different AI models and their underlying data sources.

##  Metrics Explained

### Brand Visibility Score
**What it measures:** Overall percentage score indicating how visible your brand is across all monitored sources, displayed as a gauge with contributions from each LLM (OpenAI, Perplexity, Gemini).

**Why it matters strategically:** This composite signal reveals your brand's overall presence in AI-driven conversations. The LLM breakdown is crucial because different models index different sources - a spike in Perplexity might indicate viral social media conversations, while a drop in Gemini could suggest fewer news mentions. Understanding these patterns helps you attribute changes to specific campaigns, events, or market shifts.

### Variation vs. Consolidated Visibility
**What it measures:** Two scores for competitor brands:
- **Variation**: Visibility of individual brand variants (e.g., "Hab Shifa" vs. "Habshifa")
- **Consolidated**: Combined visibility across all variants under a single brand

**Why it matters strategically:** This dual view reveals whether competitors have fragmented identities or unified brand strategies. Numerous high-scoring variations could imply brand confusion or deliberate multi-brand strategy, while consolidated scores show overall market presence. This helps you understand competitive positioning and identify opportunities.

### Prompt Score
**What it measures:** A percentage reflecting how effectively a prompt surfaces meaningful mentions, displayed with a progress bar.

**Why it matters strategically:** Higher scores indicate prompts that are pulling useful signal rather than noise. This helps you refine your monitoring strategy - low-scoring prompts may need adjustment to better align with your strategic questions, while high-scoring prompts reveal the most effective ways to monitor your brand.

### Sentiment Analysis
**What it measures:** The ratio of positive to negative sentiment detected in responses, showing percentage breakdown of positive, neutral, and negative sentiment for each prompt.

**Why it matters strategically:** Sentiment provides directional cues about whether conversations support or undermine your brand narrative. A 100% positive sentiment in a top prompt signals supportive conversations, while lower percentages alert you to potential issues. The key is to act on why sentiment is shifting rather than on the raw number.

### Topic Score
**What it measures:** Percentage score showing how significantly a topic contributes to brand visibility.

**Why it matters strategically:** A high topic score means that theme is driving your brand narrative; a low score suggests you may need to create more prompts or shift focus. This helps you understand which strategic themes matter most to your brand and where you need to invest more monitoring resources.

### Keyword Score
**What it measures:** Similar to topic score but for individual keywords, indicating the impact and relevance of specific keywords in driving brand visibility.

**Why it matters strategically:** High keyword scores suggest terms strongly associated with your brand. By comparing these scores and LLM contribution bars, you learn not just what people say, but where they're saying it. This informs SEO strategies and content creation - if "hab shifa reviews" is trending in Perplexity-driven sources, there may be buzz in question-answer communities you can nurture.

### LLM Contributions
**What it measures:** Percentage breakdown of contributions from different language models (OpenAI, Perplexity, Gemini) for any given metric or entity.

**Why it matters strategically:** This reveals which AI platforms are most active for your brand and helps you understand where your visibility comes from. Different models emphasize different sources (social media, news, forums), so understanding LLM distribution helps you tailor your strategy to the platforms that matter most.

### Prompt Mentions
**What it measures:** Number of monitored prompts that mention your brand out of the total prompts, with contributions per LLM.

**Why it matters strategically:** This indicates how effectively your monitoring strategy captures brand mentions. High prompt mentions suggest your prompts are well-aligned with conversations about your brand, while low mentions may indicate you need to refine your monitoring approach.

### Citations & Top Domains
**What it measures:** 
- **Top Domains**: Highest-cited domains with citation counts per LLM
- **Citations**: Individual URLs with associated domains and total prompt references

**Why it matters strategically:** Visibility alone doesn't tell you if your brand is being discussed on credible platforms. Citations turn raw mention counts into a map of influence, helping you understand why your visibility comes from particular sources and whether those align with your brand values. High citation counts across models suggest broad exposure, while specific URLs show exactly which articles drive your narrative.

### Rankings
**What it measures:** Rankings of prompts, topics, brands, or keywords based on scores and counts.

**Why it matters strategically:** Rankings help you identify top performers and prioritize your strategic focus. They reveal which elements of your monitoring strategy are most effective and where you should allocate resources.

### Update Timestamps
**What it measures:**
- **Last Updated**: When a prompt was last processed
- **Next Update**: When the next data collection is scheduled
- **Plan Usage**: Number of prompts used vs. total allowed in your plan

**Why it matters strategically:** These timestamps reinforce that BrandRadar is a living system that monitors continuously. They remind you when to expect fresh data and why a current lull might simply reflect the update cycle, helping you distinguish between actual trends and data collection timing.
