## Filtering for Focused Analysis

Most pages have date pickers and search boxes. Filtering helps you focus on specific campaigns, time periods, or market segments that matter to your business strategy.

**Why this matters strategically:** Filtering by date range helps you attribute changes to specific campaigns or events, while keyword filtering helps you focus on particular market segments or strategic themes. This focused analysis provides actionable insights rather than overwhelming data.

## Leverage AI-Generated Suggestions

The **Suggested prompts** feature can surface strategic questions you might not think of. Reviewing them periodically keeps your monitoring strategy fresh and aligned with emerging trends.

**Why this matters strategically:** AI-generated suggestions are based on your brand description and competitive landscape, helping you discover new monitoring opportunities and stay ahead of market changes. They provide strategic inspiration for expanding your monitoring framework.

## Maintain Brand and Competitor Intelligence

Accurate information ensures the AI identifies the right entities and ignores irrelevant mentions, providing cleaner strategic insights.
