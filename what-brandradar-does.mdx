BrandRadar's algorithm works behind the scenes to map not only your brand, but also your industry and competitive landscape. It helps businesses and agencies track answer visibility at scale, while uncovering gaps and missed opportunities such as:

* When do AI platforms mention your brand on ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude & more  
* Which user queries trigger those mentions  
* What sentiments your brand is represented in  
* How you stack against competitors  
* What action you can take
