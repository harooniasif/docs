# Brand and Competitor Configuration

BrandRadar's insights depend on how well the AI understands your brand's identity and competitive landscape. This isn't just data entry - it's teaching the system to recognize your brand and distinguish between signals that matter to your business and noise that doesn't.

## Why Configuration Matters

The AI models that power BrandRadar need to understand your brand's context to provide meaningful insights. Without proper configuration, you'll get generic data rather than intelligence. The difference between a well-configured brand and a poorly configured one is the difference between actionable insights and irrelevant noise.

**Benefits of proper setup:**
- **Precise brand recognition** across different contexts and spellings
- **Competitive intelligence** that filters out competitor noise
- **Market context** that focuses on your operational regions
- **Positioning** that aligns monitoring with your business model

<Info>
**Foundation:** Your brand and competitor configuration is the foundation of all BrandRadar insights. The AI uses this information to distinguish between your brand mentions and competitor activity, understand your market context, and generate relevant monitoring suggestions.

## Brand Detail Configuration

Click the **Data builder** icon (connected nodes symbol) in the left navigation bar. A header appears with tabs for Prompts, Topics, Brand details, and Competitor list.

Select **Brand details**. You'll see fields for your Brand name, Website, Brand variations, and Operating locations. These fields aren't just data entry - they're configuration that teaches the AI how to recognize and understand your brand.

**Why brand details matter:**
- **Brand variations** ensure you capture all relevant mentions across different spellings and contexts
- **Operating locations** focus monitoring on your actual markets, preventing false signals from irrelevant regions
- **Brand descriptions** help the AI understand your business model and generate relevant monitoring suggestions

Use the **What does your brand do?** and **What are you known for?** text boxes to describe your products or services. These descriptions are crucial for monitoring - they help the AI understand your brand's position and generate prompts that align with your business model.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Configuration">
    Click the Data builder icon in the left sidebar to access your configuration options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Brand Details Tab">
    Choose the "Brand details" tab from the available options to configure your brand's identity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Brand Information">
    Add, remove or edit Brand Variations, Operating locations, Brand Description and Brand website.  
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Click "Save changes" to store your brand configuration and update the AI's understanding of your brand.
  </Step>
</Steps>



## Competitor Configuration

Still within **Data builder**, switch to the **Competitor list** tab. Here you'll find a table listing competitors with editable fields for their domains, a textbox to enter variations and a dropdown button with all competitors set to include by default.


**Features in competitor management:**
- **Add variations to competitors**: Users can now add variations to competitors via the Competitor list page, ensuring comprehensive competitor monitoring across different spellings and contexts
- **Exclude competitors from data**: Users can now choose to exclude specific competitors from the data analysis, allowing for more focused monitoring and cleaner insights



**Why competitor configuration matters:**
- **Competitive intelligence** that filters out competitor noise from your brand analytics
- **Market positioning** that helps you understand your relative position in the competitive landscape
- **Benchmarking** that enables you to compare your brand's performance against competitors
- **Opportunity identification** that reveals gaps in competitor coverage or emerging competitive threats

Accurate competitor details allow the AI to distinguish between your brand mentions and competitor activity, providing cleaner insights about your brand's performance.
