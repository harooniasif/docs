The search battleground has shifted. Buyers no longer scroll through ten links. Unlike traditional SEO, which focuses on keywords and clicks, [Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)](https://www.brandradar.ai/resources/geo-101-generative-engine-optimization-explained-c2t1p) ensures your brand is consistently visible inside AI-generated answers. But not all GEO tools are built the same.

To stay competitive, companies need more than monitoring, they need scalable measurement, testing, and actionable insights that tie directly to the pipeline. That's where BrandRadar comes in. It's a complete framework for understanding why your brand appears (or doesn't) in AI answers, and how to turn those insights into strategy.
