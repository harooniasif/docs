BrandRadar is a comprehensive Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) platform designed to help businesses track and improve their visibility across AI platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, and Claude.

Unlike traditional SEO tools that focus on keyword rankings and search engine results, BrandRadar specializes in AI search optimization. It tracks how your brand appears in AI-generated answers, analyzes sentiment, monitors competitor positioning, and provides insights specific to the generative search landscape.

BrandRadar is built for businesses and agencies that need more than basic monitoring - they need scalable measurement, testing, and actionable insights that tie directly to business outcomes. It's a complete framework for understanding why your brand appears (or doesn't) in AI answers, and how to turn those insights into strategy.
