## Step 1: Add Your Brand Name
* Enter the official name of your brand.  
* This is the name BrandRadar will use to search and track visibility.

## Step 2: Enter Your Domain
* Provide your brand's live, official website URL.  
* BrandRadar will crawl this site for reference and validation.

## Step 3: Add Name Variations
* Include up to 10 alternative names, nicknames, or abbreviations your brand is known by.  
* This ensures we capture all mentions across AI platforms.

## Step 4: Set Your Location
* Select your brand's country and city.  
* If you operate in multiple regions, list them all.  
* For global businesses (e.g. tech or export services), choose Global.

## Step 5: Provide a Quick Intro
* BrandRadar generates a short brand overview based on your input.  
* You can edit and enrich this later for more context.

## Step 6: Add Your Competitors
* BrandRadar automatically suggests major competitors.  
* You can add others to track your visibility against them.
