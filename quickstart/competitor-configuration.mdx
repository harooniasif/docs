---

Within Data Builder, the Competitor List tab lets you manage how BrandRadar tracks and compares your competitors. Here, you can add competitor domains, include variations for different spellings or brand names, and even exclude competitors for more focused analysis. Accurate competitor configuration matters because it sharpens your competitive intelligence, helps you understand market positioning, and improves benchmarking accuracy, revealing where your brand stands and uncovering new opportunities.

## Why Does This Matter?

Accurate competitor configuration matters because it helps us find your best, most relevant competitor data.

- **Benchmark Your Brand** – Gives context for your performance so you [know exactly where you stand](https://www.brandradar.ai/#Competitor-Benchmarking).
- **Understand Market Position** – Shows how your brand compares to competitors in visibility and reach.
- **Measure Share-of-Voice** – Tracks your presence accurately across AI prompts and topics.
- **Identify Gaps** – Reveals areas where competitors are appearing but your brand isn't.
- **Actionable Strategy** – Provides insights you can act on to improve your AI visibility and stay competitive.
