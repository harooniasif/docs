Within Data Builder, the Competitor List tab lets you manage how BrandRadar tracks and compares your competitors. Here, you can add competitor domains, include variations for different spellings or brand names, and even exclude competitors for more focused analysis. Accurate competitor configuration matters because it sharpens your competitive intelligence, helps you understand market positioning, and improves benchmarking accuracy, revealing where your brand stands and uncovering new opportunities.
