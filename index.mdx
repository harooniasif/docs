## Intro to BrandRadar

BrandRadar isn’t just another dashboard that lists prompts and charts - it’s a framework for understanding why your brand appears where it does and what that means for your strategy. In an era where AI models increasingly shape how people discover and perceive brands, BrandRadar helps you decode the signals that matter.
## What BrandRadar does

- Tracks your brand's visibility across AI platforms (OpenAI, Gemini, Perplexity)
- Uses targeted prompts to surface conversations that matter, grouped into topics
- Scores visibility as a composite signal, showing which platforms drive your presence
- Benchmarks competitors and analyzes citations to reveal influence drivers

## How BrandRadar helps

- Focuses your monitoring on strategic themes, not noise
- Explains why visibility changes, tying shifts to campaigns, events, or market trends
- Surfaces conversation drivers so you can shape your narrative
- Reveals competitor positioning and gaps you can exploit
