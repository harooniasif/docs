# Welcome to BrandRadar

The search battleground has shifted. Buyers no longer scroll through ten links. Unlike traditional SEO, which focuses on keywords and clicks, Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) ensures your brand is consistently visible inside AI-generated answers.

To stay competitive, companies need more than monitoring, they need scalable measurement, testing, and actionable insights that tie directly to the pipeline. That's where BrandRadar comes in.
