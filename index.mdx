## Welcome to BrandRadar

BrandRadar isn't just another dashboard that lists prompts and charts - it's a framework for understanding **why** your brand appears where it does and **what** that means for your strategy. In an era where AI models increasingly shape how people discover and perceive brands, BrandRadar helps you decode the signals that matter.

### The  Challenge

Traditional brand monitoring tools scrape everything and overwhelm you with data. BrandRadar takes a different approach: it uses targeted queries (prompts) to instruct AI models to look for specific themes, then organizes those insights into groups (topics). This isn't about monitoring everything - it's about monitoring what matters to your brand strategy.

### Why This Matters Now

As AI becomes the primary way people search for information, your brand's visibility in AI responses directly impacts your market position. BrandRadar helps you understand:

- **Where your brand appears** across different AI platforms (OpenAI, Gemini, Perplexity)
- **Why it appears there** through strategic prompt design
- **What conversations drive visibility** via topic analysis
- **How competitors are positioning** through discovered brand intelligence
- **Which sources influence your narrative** via citation analysis

## Core Concepts

### Brand Visibility as a Composite Signal

Your brand visibility isn't a simple count of mentions - it's a composite signal derived from multiple AI models scanning diverse content and gauging how often and meaningfully your brand appears. The visibility score summarizes this into a single percentage while exposing its composition: how much each AI model contributes to your visibility.

This separation is crucial because different models index different sources. A spike in Perplexity might indicate viral social media conversations, while a drop in Gemini could suggest fewer news mentions. Understanding these patterns helps you attribute changes to specific campaigns, events, or market shifts.

###  Monitoring Through Prompts and Topics

Unlike tools that monitor everything, BrandRadar relies on **prompts** (targeted queries that instruct AI to look for specific themes) and **topics** (which organize prompts into conceptual buckets). You decide why you care about certain conversations, aligning your monitoring strategy with your marketing questions.

**Prompts** are the strategic questions you ask AI. Each prompt yields a score indicating how effectively it surfaces meaningful mentions and a sentiment metric showing whether discussions support or undermine your brand narrative.

**Topics** group prompts under broader strategic themes. A high topic score means that theme is driving your brand narrative; a low score suggests you may need to create more prompts or shift focus.
