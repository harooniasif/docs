The Data Builder is your control center for setting up and customizing brand monitoring. It's where you define your brand, competitors, topics, and prompts, everything BrandRadar needs to track your AI visibility.

It has four main tabs: Brand Details, Competitors, Topics, and Prompts.

## Brand Details
Add your brand's core information (name, domain, variations, and locations) to ensure accurate tracking across AI platforms.

## Competitors
List and manage competitor brands so you can benchmark your visibility and share-of-voice.

## Topics
Create and organize key themes or categories that help structure your monitoring around what matters most.

## Prompts
Define the specific questions, searches, and queries BrandRadar will track to measure how your brand appears in generative search.

Together, these four tabs form the foundation of your brand monitoring setup, giving you full control over what BrandRadar tracks and analyzes.
